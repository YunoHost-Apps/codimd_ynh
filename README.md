## Overview
CodiMD is a real-time collaborative word processing web service. It uses Markdown language.

**Shipped version:** 1.6.0

**Important note :**  the former CodiMD software (fork of HackMD) has been renamed HedgeDoc, while the previous HackMD software was renamed CodiMD.
For the moment, for compatibility reason this package is still called CodiMD, but **the software installed is HedgeDoc**.
